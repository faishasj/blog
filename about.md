##### A wise friend of mine once said the “About” section of a blog should really be called a “Blurg”.

Hi there! I'm Faisha. I just like to get a little curious sometimes. And if you also like to get a little curious sometimes too, that's great! Let's be a little curious together (in a completely non-weird way). 

In my posts, I write about random things that pique my interest, which usually fall into the fields of maths and computer science. I don't claim to be an expert in either.

Currently, I'm completing my undergraduate degree in CS. When I'm not deep into having an existential crisis, I'm starting another random side project that will inevitably be forgotten. 

Hopefully, this blog is not one of them.
