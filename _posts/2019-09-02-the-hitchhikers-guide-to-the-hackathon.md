This year I’ve attended two hackathons, with the former being my first one ever. And although I didn’t win either of them, I thought I’d bless my readers with some unsolicited advice on how to survive one. So here are seven tips that are so amazing~~ly average~~ you won’t even need the Red Bull.

## 1. Set your expectations straight

This is not a post on how to *win* a hackathon (and not only because I am totally unqualified). Some people are in it to win it, whilst others aren’t. I personally like to go to hackathons to have a try at something new and have fun doing it, and then leave just before the pitch (don't be me).

Some like to be prepared before the hackathon with ideas, a pitch and a presentation, whilst others believe that the ideation phase should only start after the hackathon begins.

Whichever way you swing, expect that your team members may not approach the hackathon the same way that you do and be mindful to ensure a fun hackathon for everyone. Yay for diverse mindsets!

## 2. Make use of a diverse team

Speaking of diversity, try and ensure your team members can all bring something different to the table. A diverse range of backgrounds and skillsets means that each team member has more to contribute to the outcome of the hack. 

Moreover, you’ll get different informed views and opinions on how your product may be servicing (or not servicing) your target audience. It’s no surprise that a diverse team is crucial to developing a successful product. If your team is not 
as diverse as you would like in order to get feedback on your product, this next tip is for you.

## 3. Talk with other teams

Just like the tech community (up for debate), hackathons often cultivate a collaborative environment. So talk to other teams! Make new friends, share tips and ideas, ask and give feedback. No one is going to steal your idea. If you're a business-minded person, a hackathon is basically one big networking opportunity. 

## 4. Decide on a tech stack

On the more technical side, for the love of God just decide on a stack and stick with it. If you’re going for something doable, pick a set of technologies your team is comfortable with. If you’re wanting a challenge, pick something completely new and by the next morning you would have hopefully learnt something new, as well as hopefully hacked together an MVP? Either way, sticking to one stack saves a lot of time and frustration.

~~And for a web app, you can’t go wrong with React + Firebase.~~

## 5. Embrace the pivot

In my last hackathon we jumped ship on an idea five hours in after battling with our tech stack. It's okay to pivot. In fact I'd argue you should embrace the pivot at a hackathon. Sometimes things don't work out and that's okay. Take this opportunity to brainstorm some new and better ideas together, revise your gameplan and get back to hacking!

## 6. Ask for help and use the mentors

If you're at a hackathon there is a high chance that there will be mentors roaming around for you to ask help from. Use them. They're experts and they're there for you. If you're stuck on an implementation or need some practice with pitching, they're more than happy to lend a hand.

And again, if you're a business-minded person, maybe now's the time to use your  networking skills you've been working on and charm those industry professionals.

## 7. Adopt the spirit of the hack

Hackathons are meant to be fun. So enjoy that time hacking with your team! Take breaks, go to talks and workshops, stack cans of Red Bull, play hackathon bingo (something we did at the last hackathon) and embrace the spirit of the hack. 

Happy hacking!
