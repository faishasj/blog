#### Just another obligatory Hello, World! post.

A completely consequential decision for this *very* significant and popular blog. I have decided to move my blog from Wordpress to Jekyll and host it on GitHub pages... because? Because. I will be moving my posts over, so if you were one of my 7 followers on Wordpress, welcome back! Also, how did you find this blog?

If you're new to the blog, hi there! I’m Faisha. I just like to get a little curious sometimes. And if you also like to get a little curious sometimes too, that’s great! Let’s be a little curious together (in a completely non-weird way). In my posts, I write about random things that pique my interest, which usually fall into the fields of maths and computer science.

Currently, I’m completing my undergraduate degree in CS. When I’m not deep into having an existential crisis, I’m starting another random side project that will inevitably be forgotten.

Hopefully, this blog is not one of them.
