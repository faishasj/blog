Just my personal blog. If you stumbled upon this repository and are yet to be convinced that you should have a read, here is an excerpt from my blurg (it's actually the whole thing):

> Hi there! I'm Faisha. I just like to get a little curious sometimes. And if you also like to get a little curious sometimes too, that's great! Let's be a little curious together (in a completely non-weird way). 

>In my posts, I write about random things that pique my interest, which usually fall into the fields of maths and computer science. I don't claim to be an expert in either.

>Currently, I'm completing my undergraduate degree in CS. When I'm not deep into having an existential crisis, I'm starting another random side project that will inevitably be forgotten. 

>Hopefully, this blog is not one of them.
